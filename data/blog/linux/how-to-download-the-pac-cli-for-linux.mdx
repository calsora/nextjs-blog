I’ve recently added Linux (Ubuntu) to my Mac Book pro 2015 to see if it can last me a couple more years as it couldn’t handle anymore system updates anymore.

With this in mind, I wanted to try and use it as my development machine for personal projects to see what it could handle. Plus, to have an escape from Copilot.

## Why PAC CLI

Its one of the essential tools for any developer or administrator of the Power Platform. You can find useful commands [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction?tabs=windows).

## Installation

Out of interest (as of 19/11/25) despite the prerequisites saying 6.0 sdk is required for the PAC CLI you actually need 9.0 for Linux (Ubuntu).

I couldn’t get the snap download to work for 9.0 so I ended up directly downloading the sdk from [<mark>Ubuntu</mark>](http://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-install?tabs=dotnet9&pivots=os-linux-ubuntu-2404) and running the below commands.

```bash
sudo apt-get update && \
  sudo apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-9.0
```

Go ahead and download the extension from VS Code and reload VS code.

Proof it works :)
