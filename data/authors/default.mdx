Hey👋 I am based in the UK and I currently work as a Power Platform & D365 developer.

This is my blog where I share my own insights with Power Pages so that it might help someone out there.

My first professional job was in IT support and luckily I got introduced to Power Automate and that got me interested with the Power Platform.

I then discovered Power Pages and it seemed like a great fit as I really enjoyed building websites at university and in my own spare time.

Ever since 2021 I’ve been having fun with Power Portals and wanted to share my journey with it.
